Todo apps are great because they're a simple implimentation of a crud application.

This originally was part of a code challenge in a separate git repo. I didn't get the gig, but I figured I'd keep hacking on this since it's pretty basic, and it would be a good way to learn webpack, angular unit testing, and mongoose.

Node and Webpack needs to be installed for this to work.

To use this app, run: 

`npm install`
`nodemon`

To run tests: `npm test`

A lot of this app is based off of [Treehouse Mean Stack course](https://github.com/treehouse-projects/mean-todo)

I refactored the client side code, configured jasmine/karma tests, added remote database with mongoLabs
