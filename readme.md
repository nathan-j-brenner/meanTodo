Todo apps are great because they're a simple implimentation of a crud application.

This originally was part of a code challenge in a separate git repo. I didn't get the gig, but I figured I'd keep hacking on this since it's pretty basic, and it would be a good way to learn webpack, angular unit testing, and mongoose.

Node needs to be installed for this to work.

To use this app, run: 

`npm install`
'webpack'
`npm run dev`

To run tests: `npm test`
